# CryptoPe

Cryptope is a decentralized application (dApp) that aims to simplify crypto payments and provide transparent transaction histories using blockchain technology. It is designed to enhance the user experience and streamline the process of making and tracking cryptocurrency payments.

The primary feature of Cryptope is its ability to simplify crypto payments. It provides an intuitive interface that allows users to send and receive various cryptocurrencies easily. Users can select their desired cryptocurrency, input the recipient's wallet address, and specify the amount to be sent. Cryptope then securely processes the transaction on the underlying blockchain network, ensuring that the funds are transferred accurately and reliably.

Furthermore, Cryptope allows users to view the past receivers of their crypto payments. This feature enables users to track the flow of funds and provides insights into their spending patterns. By having access to this information, users can better manage their finances, track their expenses, and analyze their transaction history.

This project is currently deployed over Polygon Mumbai network using Zeeve RPC.
